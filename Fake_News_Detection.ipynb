Sessions\\u2019 memo to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the agency under the Department of Justice that conducts immigration court proceedings, called on judges and staff to do what they can \\u201cconsistent with the law\\u201d to \\u201cincrease productivity, enhance efficiencies, and ensure the timely and proper administration of justice.\\u201d President Donald Trump\\u2019s administration has so far brought on 50 new immigration judges, Sessions said, in an effort to pare back a backlog of more than 600,000 cases. Sessions said in his memo that the Justice Department plans to hire 60 more judges in the next six months to cut the pending case load in half by 2020. Statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday showed that although the government arrested far more people suspected of being in the United States illegally in 2017 than it did last year, it deported fewer illegal immigrants. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed approximately 226,000 people from the country in the 2017 fiscal year, down 6 percent from the previous year and lower than at any time during the Obama administration. Trump has made strict immigration enforcement a major priority of his administration. The slowdown is in part because fewer people appear to be trying to cross the U.S. border illegally. Another reason is that although immigration arrests are up, the court backlog has slowed the removal of immigrants who claim they will be harmed if they are deported to their home countries or have other justifications for staying in the United States. Under U.S. policy, many of those claims must be adjudicated by an immigration judge.  In his memo, Sessions touted a surge of immigration judges to the U.S. border and said the agency completed about 2,800 more cases than projected. In April, Reuters reported that two of the eight immigration judges deployed to the U.S. border with Mexico to process asylum requests from migrant women and children were being recalled because they had so few cases to hear. The department also said that from February through November, removal orders were up 30 percent over the same time last year, and the percentage of final decisions on cases was up nearly 17 percent compared with last year. \",\n          \"Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs recruit, now serving as Trump s White House economic adviser and has assets worth $252 million to $611 million, says that under the former reality show star s tax plan you can buy a brand new car for $1,000, but that s not all, folks, In addition to that, you can renovate your entire kitchen for $1,000. And you can buy a UNICORN for just five bucks, and all because Trump is the best person ever!Cohn took the podium to tell voters about all of this good news which has to be for real because Trump is going to MAGA so hard, you ll also be able to take your family on a vacation for $1,000. Are you getting goosebumps, too? If we allow a family to keep another $1,000, they can renovate their kitchen, they can buy a new car, they can take a family vacation,  Cohn said.Maybe Cohn meant you can take your family on a vacay in your basement for $1,000.

People just like Gary Cohn. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the top 1 percent of Americans would get half of the tax cuts under Trump s plan. By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close. Missed it by that much! The average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $21,797. According to American Express, the average vacation expense per person in the United States is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four.Image via screen capture. \",\n          \"Donald Trump took his angry little fingers to his Twitter account Thursday morning, threatening to abandon recovery efforts in Puerto Rico where the majority of the hurricane-devastated island s residents remain without power, water and food.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello immediately responded on Thursday to President Trump s warning, saying that the U.S. territory s residents are only asking for the same assistance that other Americans would receive. You know, like in Texas and Florida, two states which helped bring Trump to power. And yet, Trump did not issue threats to those states.

Trump added:  These are great people. We want them to be safe and sound and secure. And we will be there every day until that happens. Two weeks later, Trump threatens to pull recovery efforts from the island while shaming the island for its debt   even though he filed for bankruptcy six times.Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
